        <h2>About the Aanchal Community</h2>
        <p>
          Aanchal's online Community is lively, supportive, and honest. With
          more than 9 million members worldwide and thousands of birth clubs and
          other groups, the Community is a welcoming place to connect with other
          parents and celebrate the journey of pregnancy and parenting. Please
          keep in mind that everything you read in our Community areas comes
          from other members. Because our Community is so large, Aanchal isn't
          able to monitor, review, or verify all information posted by our
          members. Our professional moderators enforce our Community guidelines
          and review all content reported to BabyCenter staff. Our Community is
          governed by our Terms of Use.

        <h2>Medical Advisory Board</h2>
        <p>
          Any content containing medical information or guidance on health or
          development is reviewed by a doctor or healthcare professional on
          Aanchal's Medical Advisory Board. (For example, an article on the
          stages of labor would be reviewed by an ob-gyn, and a video on
          breastfeeding by a lactation consultant.) These experts help make sure
          BabyCenter provides the most complete and accurate pregnancy and
          parenting information possible. Our advisory board members are highly
          respected professionals at the top of their fields who are selected
          based on their range of knowledge and experience. Their specialties
          include fertility, obstetrics, midwifery, pediatrics, child
          development, and emotional health. See our medical advisory board.
