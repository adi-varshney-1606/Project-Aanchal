        <h1>“The wisdom and compassion a woman can intuitively experience in childbirth can make her a source of healing
          and understanding for other women.”</h1><br>
        <h2>Why You Might Want to Choose a Doula/Midwife?</h2>
        <p> A doula can help you and the dad-to-be have a positive and safe birth experience: <br>
          -During labor, a doula can take over coaching now and then to give the dad a break. <br>
          -When desired, a doula can completely free the dad-to-be from coaching tasks and from having to remember the
          instructions from your childbirth classes. They can enjoy the process and focus on supporting you emotionally.
          <br>
          -Studies show that women who use a doula have shorter labors, are less likely to need a C-section, request
          less pain medication, and have a more positive childbirth experience. <br>
          -Moms who used doulas after birth may have more success with breastfeeding</p>
